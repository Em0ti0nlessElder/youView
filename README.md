# youView
A custom script to unblock any YouTube video.
This is a bookmarklet. 

Instructions:

1. Click on the link labeled v1.0 under releases on the right side of the screen.

2. Click on youView.html. This should download a file.

3. Click on the 3 dots on the top right of your screen, open Bookmarks, and click on Bookmark manager.

4. On Bookmark manager, click on the 3 dots on the top right and click Import bookmarks.

5. Select youView.html from your files. This will import the unblocker.

6. Open any website. 

7. Click the bookmark you've just imported then paste in the link of the YouTube video you desire.

8. If it does not work, this doesn't mean it's broken. Some sites may not work. I recommend using Google.com.
